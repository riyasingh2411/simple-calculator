🚀 How It Works

The program asks the user to input two numbers.

It then prompts the user to choose an operation:

+ for addition

- for subtraction

* for multiplication

/ for division

Based on the user’s choice, it performs the corresponding arithmetic operation and prints the result.

If an invalid operator is entered, the program prints "invalid choice".

💻 Example Usage
# Run the program
python "simple calculator.py"


Sample Input/Output:

enter 1st number: 10
enter 2nd number: 5
enter your choice +,-,*,/: *
Result: 50

⚙️ Requirements

Python 3.x

🧠 Concepts Used

Input and output functions

Conditional statements (if, elif, else)

Basic arithmetic operators

📝 Future Improvements

Add error handling for invalid numeric input.

Support floating-point numbers and modulus operation.

Implement a menu-driven loop to perform multiple operations without restarting the program.
